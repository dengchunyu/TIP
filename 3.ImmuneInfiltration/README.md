# Infiltration
## Code
The TIP web server source code including two sections,immune activity score and CIBERSORT immune infiltration,the code in this project is about CIBERSORT immune infiltration. 

### The code for webserver results arrangement  
**1.CIBERSORT_server.R**  
The final execute function, all code files are on tap. export final results.  

**2.CIBERSORT_main.R**  
Change the CIBERSORT infiltration results to interactive graphics data that the TIP need.  

### The most important code about immune infiltration come from CIBERSORT v1.03,little revise

**3.CIBERSORT_func.R**  
Compute infiltration proportion.

**4.CoreAlg.R**  
Core algorithm  

**5.doPerm.R**   
Do permutations
